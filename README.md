# Sprint 3 Mid-Week Skills Check - Recursion

The purpose of this skill check is to gauge your current level of skill and
understanding of Sprint 3 content. Based on the results of this skill check,
your instructors will be able to help provide more targeted support so you are
ready for the assessment in a few days.

This problem may feel challenging, and that is OK. You will need to use Polya's
problem solving framework to understand the problem, make a plan, carry out the
plan, and look back and improve your solution.

If you pass all of the test specs, then you are in a great place moving through
this sprint! If you do not pass all of the tests, your instructors will use the
results of the skill check to target specific areas to get you ready for the
assessment at the end of the sprint.

## Setup

1. Download and unzip the skeleton from the link
2. Rename the folder to `firstname-lastname-sprint-3-skill-check`. For
   example, if your name is "Jane Doe", then name your folder
   `jane-doe-sprint-3-skill-check`
3. In the terminal, `cd` into the project folder and run `npm install`
   to install dependencies


As you are working on the problems, you can run the local test cases for
debugging purposes by running the following command:

`node problems/find-duplicates.js`

Run `npm test` to run all test specs.

**Important Note**: The test specs are set up so that you MUST complete the prior problem(s) before moving on to the next problem. Once you solve a problem and pass the test spec for that problem, DO NOT comment out your function(s). Do not define your function using fat arrow syntax as they will not pass the test specs. You will need to create a new function to pass each test.

## Working through the problem(s)

Keep in mind the following tips as you work through the problem(s):

- Work through the problem(s) in order
- The tasks get harder as you move through the problems
- The goal IS NOT to achieve 100% of the points
- The goal IS to get as far as you can in 30 minutes - partial credit will help
  your instructors to help you
- If you struggle, share where you got stuck on your daily report - this will
  also help your instructors plan extra support for you

## Submission

When you are ready to submit:

1. Re-run all unit tests and fix any syntax errors that are crashing the tests.
If the unit tests crash, or do not run, you will not receive any points on the
skill check
2. **Delete the `node_modules` directory**
3. Zip up your folder
4. Upload it
